    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Yiheng Zhu, but you can just call me Ian. 
        I come from Jingjiang, a small and picturesque town in China that's close to my heart. 
        Right now, I'm a sophomore computer science major student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>While my education focuses on technology and engineering, one of my true passions lies in the world of music. 
        I love playing various instruments, and there's a special joy I find in producing my own music. 
        There's something about combining melodies and rhythms that truly captivates me.
        That being said, I'm also quite enthusiastic about coding. 
        Watching my codes come to life and run smoothly gives me a sense of accomplishment. 
        In the future, I'm keen on exploring hardware coding, blending the tangible with the intangible.
        I believe that a mix of creativity from music and logic from coding makes my journey unique. 
        I'm eager to learn more and grow in both fields, and I'm excited to see where my passions take me!</p>
